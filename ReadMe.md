# Quick Send üöÄ

**Quick Send** is a real-time, peer-to-peer (P2P)-inspired file sharing web app built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Socket.IO**, designed for fast, direct file transfers between devices on the same network ‚Äî all through your browser, with no installation or sign-up required.

---

## üåü Goals

- Provide a free, open-source tool for local network file sharing.  
- Ensure ease of use: no user accounts, no app installs.  
- Explore P2P-style transfers that emphasize speed, privacy, and minimal server intervention.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Transfer**: File chunks are streamed between peers (via Socket.IO relay).  
- **No Sign-Up**: 100% in-browser, no user accounts needed.  
- **Easy Connections**: Share Room Code or scan a QR to connect.  
- **Modern File Handling**: Uses File System Access API when available.  
- **File Size Limit**: Configurable limit (e.g., 1GB) to prevent oversized file transfers.  
- **Responsive UI**: Includes dark/light themes, connection status, and progress feedback.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)

### Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aniket-Mani/Quick-Send
cd quick-send
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root with:

```env
PORT=5050
```

### Start the Server

```bash
node server.js
# or with auto-reload:
npx nodemon server.js
```

---

## üåê Access the App

- **Sender**: http://localhost:5050  
- **Receiver**: http://localhost:5050/receiver.html

To test across devices on the same local network, replace `localhost` with your machine‚Äôs local IP:

```
http://<your-local-ip>:5050
http://<your-local-ip>:5050/receiver.html
```

## üìñ Usage Instructions

### üì® Sender

1. Go to `http://localhost:5050`  
2. Click **Send Files**  
3. Share the generated **Room Code** or **QR Code**  
4. Wait for the receiver to join  
5. Select and send a file

### üì• Receiver

1. Go to `http://localhost:5050/receiver.html`  
2. Connect using:  
   - **Room Code**, or  
   - **QR Scan** (allow camera access)  
3. Choose where to save the file if prompted  
4. File will auto-download when transfer completes

> If File System Access API isn‚Äôt supported, file is downloaded via memory buffer (may fail for large files)

---

## üîß Configuration

- **Port**: Set in `.env`  
- **Server Constants**: Modify `server.js`  
  - `MAX_CHUNK_BUFFER_SIZE`  
  - `PING_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT`  
  - `TRANSFER_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT`  
- **Client File Size Limit**: Set in `main.js`

## üôã FAQ

### ‚ùì Does this use true P2P (WebRTC)?

No. It currently uses Socket.IO as a relay. WebRTC may be integrated in future versions.

### ‚ùì Why do large transfers fail?

If the File System Access API is unsupported, the file is buffered in memory, which can exceed browser limits.

### ‚ùì Why doesn't QR scanning work via local IP?

QR scanning requires camera access, which is only allowed in secure contexts (HTTPS or localhost). Workarounds include setting up HTTPS or using `localhost`.

### ‚ùì Can I send multiple files?

Not yet. Only one file per session is currently supported.

### ‚ùì Is the transfer encrypted?

Not by default. To encrypt the connection, serve over **HTTPS**. WebRTC (when implemented) uses **DTLS encryption**.
